About
-----

This was a tool developed in C# to remotely manage users and computers connected to a Windows domain. 
The project isn't entirely complete and was built for a unique setup without flexibility in mind.  
  
As time permits I will re-write it to be more flexible for more basic setups.

I would LOVE to see any additions/changes from anyone interested in remoteley managing and automating taks 
in a Windows AD environment. Submit a pull request and I'll either create an additional branch or merge it 
depending on what the changes bring.  
  
Email david at libryder -dot- com for any suggestions or help.
